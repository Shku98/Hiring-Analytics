# Here's what I'll be doing:


Handling Missing Data: Check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to handle them.

Clubbing Columns: If there are columns with multiple categories that can be combined, do so to simplify your analysis.

Outlier Detection: Check for outliers in the dataset that may skew your analysis.

Removing Outliers: Decide on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation.

Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing your data, summarize your findings. This could involve calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. It could also involve creating visualizations to better understand the data.
